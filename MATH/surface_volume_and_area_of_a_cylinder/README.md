Write a Python program to calculate surface volume and area of a cylinder. <br>
Note: A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes, the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.<br>
Test Data:<br>
volume : Height (4), Radius(6)<br>
Expected Output:<br>
Volume is : 452.57142857142856<br>
Surface Area is : 377.1428571428571
