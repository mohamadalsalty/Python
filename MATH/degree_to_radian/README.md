Write a Python program to convert degree to radian. Go to the editor<br>
Note : The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. <br>
An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; <br>
one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius).<br>
Test Data:<br>
Degree : 15<br>
Expected Result in radians: 0.2619047619047619<br>
