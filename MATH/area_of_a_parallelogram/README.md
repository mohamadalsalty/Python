<p>Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram. <br>
Note : A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal). A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.<br>
Test Data:<br>
Length of base : 5<br>
Height of parallelogram : 6<br>
Expected Output: Area is : 30.0
