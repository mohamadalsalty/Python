<p>Write a Python program to calculate the area of a trapezoid.<br>
Note : A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two sides parallel.<br> The trapezoid is equivalent to the British definition of the trapezium.<br> An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid in which the base angles are equal so.<br>
Test Data:<br>
Height : 5<br>
Base, first value : 5<br>
Base, second value : 6<br>
Expected Output: Area is : 27.5<br>
