Write a Python program to calculate arc length of an angle.<br>
Note: In a planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.<br> Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane.<br>
Test Data:<br>
Diameter of a circle : 8<br>
Angle measure : 45<br>
Expected Output :<br>
Arc Length is : 3.142857142857143<br>
